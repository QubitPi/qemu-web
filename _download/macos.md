QEMU can be installed from <strong>Homebrew</strong>:

<pre>brew install qemu</pre>

QEMU can be installed from <strong>MacPorts</strong>:

<pre>sudo port install qemu</pre>

QEMU requires the most recent macOS version that is currently available.
Support for the last previous version will be dropped two years after the
current version has been released or when Apple drops support for it,
whatever comes first.
