The [main documentation section](https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/)
is the first place to go in case you have questions about using QEMU.

Most of the documentation is generated automatically from the QEMU git source
tree, however some text files have not been converted to the new format yet.
These documentation files can be browsed via the
[git web interface](https://git.qemu.org/?p=qemu.git;a=tree;f=docs;hb=master)
instead.

The [QEMU wiki](https://wiki.qemu.org) contains more
[user documentation](https://wiki.qemu.org/Category:User_documentation) and
[developer documentation](https://wiki.qemu.org/Category:Developer_documentation)
that has not been integrated into the QEMU git tree.
