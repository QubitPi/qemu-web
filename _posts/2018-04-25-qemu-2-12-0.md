Highlights include:

 * Spectre/Meltdown mitigation support for x86/pseries/s390 guests. For
   more details see:
     https://www.qemu.org/2018/02/14/qemu-2-11-1-and-spectre-update/
 * Numerous block support improvements, including support for directly
   interacting with userspace NVMe driver, and general improvements to
   NBD server/client including more efficient reads of sparse files
 * Networking support for VMWare paravirtualized RDMA device (RDMA
   HCA and Soft-RoCE supported), CAN bus support via Linux SocketCAN and
   SJA1000-based PCI interfaces, and general improvements for dual-stack
   IPv4/IPv6 environments
 * GUI security/bug fixes, dmabufs support for GTK/Spice.
 * Better IPMI support for Platform Events and SEL logging in internal
   BMC emulation
 * SMBIOS support for "OEM Strings", which can be used for automating
   guest image activation without relying on network-based querying
 * Disk cache information via virtio-balloon
 * ARM: AArch64 new instructions for FCMA/RDM and SIMD/FP16/crypto/complex
   number extensions
 * ARM: initial support for Raspberry Pi 3 machine type
 * ARM: Corex-M33/Armv8-M emulation via new mps2-an505 board and many

 * PowerPC: PPC4xx emulation improvements, including I2C bus support
 * PowerPC: new Sam460ex machine type
 * PowerPC: significant TCG performance improvements
 * PowerPC: pseries: support for Spectre/Meltdown mitigations
 * RISC-V: new RISC-V target via "spike_v1.9.1", "spike_v1.10", and "virt"

   and guest support for multiple CSSs
 * s390: general PCI improvements, MSI-X support for virtio-pci devices
 * s390: improved TCG emulation support
 * s390: KVM support for systems larger than 7.999TB
 * SPARC: sun4u power device emulation
