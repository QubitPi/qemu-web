QEMU is applying to Google Summer of Code 2021 and is participating in
Outreachy May-August 2021. Both of these open source internship programs offer
remote work opportunities for new developers wishing to get involved in our
community.

Interns work with mentors who support them in their project. The code developed
during the project is submitted via the same open source development process
that all QEMU code follows. This gives interns experience with contributing to
open source software.

QEMU's mentors are experienced contributors who enjoy working with talented
individuals who are getting started in open source. You can find a list of
project ideas that mentors are proposing
[here](https://wiki.qemu.org/Google_Summer_of_Code_2021).

## Outreachy
Initial applications are open until February 22nd at 16:00 UTC. Outreachy's
goal is to increase diversity in open source and is open to anyone who faces
under-representation, systemic bias, or discrimination in the technology
industry of their country.

You can learn more about Outreachy May-August and how to apply at the
[Outreachy website](https://www.outreachy.org/).

## Google Summer of Code
Google Summer of Code (GSOC) is a 10-week internship for students. Applications
are open from March 29th to April 13th. You can find the details of how to
apply at the [Google Summer of Code
website](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/).

Google will announced accepted organizations on March 9th. QEMU is applying and
we hope to mentors GSoC interns again this year!

Please review the [eligibility criteria for
GSoC](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/faq#what_are_the_eligibility_requirements_for_participation)
before applying.
