 * Live migration support for external processes running on QEMU D-Bus
 * Support for using memory backends for main/"built-in" guest RAM
 * block: support for compressed backup images via block jobs
 * block: qemu-img: 'measure' command now supports LUKS images, 'convert'
   command now supports skipping zero'ing of target image
 * block: experimental support for qemu-storage-daemon, which provides access
   to QEMU block-layer/QMP features like blocks jobs or built-in NBD server
   without starting a full VM
 * ARM: support for the following architecture features:
   ARMv8.1 VHE/VMID16/PAN/PMU

 * PowerPC: 'powernv' machine can now emulate KVM hardware acceleration to run
   KVM guests while in TCG mode
 * PowerPC: support for file-backed NVDIMMs for persistent memory emulation
 * RISC-V: 'virt' and 'sifive_u' boards now support generic syscon drivers in
   Linux to control power/reboot
