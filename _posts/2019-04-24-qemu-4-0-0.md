We would like to announce the availability of the QEMU 4.0.0 release.
This release contains 3100+ commits from 220 authors.

You can grab the tarball from our 
[download page](https://www.qemu.org/download/#source).
The full list of changes are available
[in the Wiki](https://wiki.qemu.org/ChangeLog/4.0).

Highlights include:

 * ARM: ARMv8+ extensions for SB, PredInv, HPD, LOR, FHM, AA32HPD,
   PAuth, JSConv, CondM, FRINT, and BTI
 * ARM: new emulation support for "Musca" and "MPS2" development boards
 * ARM: virt: support for >255GB of RAM and u-boot "noload" image types
 * ARM: improved emulation of ARM PMU
 * HPPA: support for TLB protection IDs and TLB trace events
 * MIPS: support for multi-threaded TCG emulation
 * MIPS: emulation support for I7200 I6500 CPUs, QMP-base querying of
   CPU types, and improved support for SAARI and SAAR configuration registers
 * MIPS: improvements to Interthread Communication Unit, Fulong 2E
   machine types, and end-user documentation.
 * PowerPC: pseries/powernv: support for POWER9 large decrementer
 * PowerPC: pseries: emulation support for XIVE interrupt controller
 * PowerPC: pseries: support for hotplugging PCI host bridges (PHBs)
 * PowerPC: pseries: Spectre/Meltdown mitigations enabled by default,
   additional support for count-cache-flush mitigation
 * RISC-V: virt: support for PCI and USB
 * RISC-V: support for TSR, TW, and TVM fields of mstatus, FS field now
   supports three stats (dirty, clean, and off)
 * RISC-V: built-in gdbserver supports register lists via XML files
 * s390: support for z14 GA 2 CPU model, Multiple-epoch and PTFF
   features now enabled in z14 CPU model by default
 * s390: vfio-ap: now supports hot plug/unplug, and no longer inhibits memory
   ballooning
 * s390: emulation support for floating-point extension facility and
   vector support instructions
 * x86: HAX accelerator now supported POSIX hosts other than Darwin,
   including Linux and NetBSD
 * x86: Q35: advertised PCIe root port speeds will now optimally default
   to maximum link speed (16GT/s) and width (x32) provided by PCIe 4.0 for
   QEMU 4.0+ machine types; older machine types will retain 2.5GT/x1
   defaults for compatibility.
 * x86: Xen PVH images can now be booted with "-kernel" option
 * Xtensa: xtfpga: improved SMP support for linux (interrupt
   distributor, IPI, and runstall) and new SMP-capable test_mmuhifi_c3
   core configuration
 * Xtensa: support for Flexible length instructions extension (FLIX)
 * GUI: new '-display spice-app' to configure/launch a Spice client GUI with
   a similar UI to QEMU GTK. VNC server now supports access controls via
   tls-authz/sasl-authz options
 * QMP: support for "out-of-band" command execution, can be useful for
   postcopy migration recovery. Additional QMP commands for working with
   block devices and dirty bitmaps
 * VFIO: EDID interface for supported mdev (Intel vGPU for kernel 5.0+),
   allows resolution setting via xres/yres options.
 * Xen: new 'xen-disk' device which can create a Xen PV disk backend,
   and performance improvements for Xen PV disk backend.
 * Network Block Device: improved tracing and error diagnostics, improved
   client compatibility with buggy NBD server implementations, new
   --bitmap, --list, --tls-authz options for qemu-nbd
 * virtio-blk now supports DISCARD and WRITE_ZEROES
 * pvrdma device now supports RDMA Management Datagram services (MAD)
 * and lots more...

Thank you to everyone involved!
