QEMU is offering open source internships in
[Outreachy's](https://www.outreachy.org/) May-August 2022 round. You can submit
your application until February 25th 2022 if you want to contribute to QEMU in
a remote work internship this summer.

Outreachy internships are extended to people who are subject to systemic bias
and underrepresentation in the technical industry where they are living. For
details on applying, please see the [Outreachy
website](https://www.outreachy.org/apply/). If you are not eligible, don't
worry, QEMU is also applying to participate in Google Summer of Code again and
we hope to share news about additional internships later this year.

Outreachy interns work together with their mentors, experienced QEMU
contributors who support their interns in their projects. Code developed during
the internship is submitted via the same open source development process that
all QEMU code follows. This gives interns experience with contributing to open
source software. Some interns then choose to pursue a career in open source
software after completing their internship.

Now is the chance to get involved in QEMU development!

If you have questions about applying for QEMU Outreachy, please email [Stefan
Hajnoczi](mailto:stefanha@gmail.com) or ask on the [#qemu-gsoc IRC
channel](https://webchat.oftc.net/?channels=qemu-gsoc).
