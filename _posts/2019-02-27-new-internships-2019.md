QEMU is once again participating in [Google Summer of
Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) and
[Outreachy](https://www.outreachy.org/) this year!  These open source
internship programs offer full-time remote work opportunities for talented new
developers wishing to get involved in our community.

Each intern works with one or more mentors who support them in their project.
Code is submitted according to QEMU's normal development process, giving the
intern experience in open source software development.  Our projects range from
device emulation to performance optimization to test infrastructure.

If you are interested in contributing to QEMU through a paid 12-week internship
from May to August 2019, take a look at [our GSoC
page](https://wiki.qemu.org/Google_Summer_of_Code_2019) and [our Outreachy
page](https://wiki.qemu.org/Outreachy_2019_MayAugust) for more information.

Both GSoC and Outreachy have eligibility criteria, which you can review [here
(GSoC)](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/faq#what_are_the_eligibility_requirements_for_participation)
and [here (Outreachy)](https://www.outreachy.org/apply/eligibility/) before

You can read about projects that were completed in 2018

These internships are generously funded by Google (GSoC) and Red Hat
