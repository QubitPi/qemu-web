QEMU has been accepted into [Google Summer of Code
2021](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) and we look forward to mentoring
talented students from around the world as they make open source contributions
this summer. GSoC is a remote work open source internship program where
students work on a project for an open source organization like QEMU.

Check out the [project ideas
page](https://wiki.qemu.org/Google_Summer_of_Code_2021) where there are 10
projects that [eligible
students](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/faq#what_are_the_eligibility_requirements_for_participation)
can apply for. This year we have C, Rust, and Python projects in various areas
related to emulation and virtualization.

If you are a student who is interested in doing an internship this summer, head
