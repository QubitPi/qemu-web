We would like to announce the availability of the QEMU 4.1.0 release.
This release contains 2000+ commits from 176 authors.

You can grab the tarball from our 
[download page](https://www.qemu.org/download/#source).
The full list of changes are available
[in the Wiki](https://wiki.qemu.org/ChangeLog/4.1).

Highlights include:

 * ARM: FPU emulation support for Cortex-M CPUs, FPU fixes for Cortex-R5F
 * ARM: ARMv8.5-RNG extension support for CPU-generated random numbers
 * ARM: board build options now configurable via new Kconfig-based system
 * ARM: Exynos4210 SoC model now supports PL330 DMA controllers
 * MIPS: improved emulation performance of numerous MSA instructions,
         mostly integer and data permuting operations
 * MIPS: improved support for MSA ASE instructions on big-endian hosts,
         handling for 'division by zero' cases now matches reference
         hardware
 * PowerPC: pseries: support for NVIDIA V100 GPU/NVLink2 passthrough via
            VFIO
 * PowerPC: pseries: in-kernel acceleration for XIVE interrupt controller
 * PowerPC: pseries: supporting for hot-plugging PCI host bridges
 * PowerPC: emulation optimizations for vector (Altivec/VSX) instructions
 * RISC-V: support for new "spike" machine model
 * RISC-V: ISA 1.11.0 support for privileged architectures
 * RISC-V: improvements for 32-bit syscall ABI, illegal instruction
           handling, and built-in debugger
 * RISC-V: support for CPU topology in device trees
 * s390: bios support for booting from ECKD DASD assigned to guest via
         vfio-ccw
 * s390: emulation support for all "Vector Facility" instructions
 * s390: additional facilities and support for gen15 machines, including
         support for AP Queue Interruption Facility for using interrupts
         for vfio-ap devices
 * SPARC: sun4m: sun4u: fixes when running with -vga none (OpenBIOS)
 * x86: emulation support for new Hygon Dhyana and Intel SnowRidge CPU
        models
 * x86: emulation support for RDRAND extension
 * x86: md-clear/mds-no feature flags, for detection/mitigation of MDS
        vulnerabilities (CVE-2018-12126, CVE-2018-12127, CVE-2018-12130,
        CVE-2019-11091)
 * x86: CPU die topology now configurable using -smp ...,dies=
 * Xtensa: support for memory protection unit (MPU) option
 * Xtensa: support for Exclusive Access option
 * GUI: virtio-gpu 2D/3D rendering may now be offloaded to an external
        vhost-user process, such as QEMU vhost-user-gpu
 * GUI: semihosting output can now be redirected to a chardev backend
 * qemu-img: added a --salvage option to qemu-img convert, which prevents
             the conversion process from aborting on I/O errors (can be
             used for example to salvage partially corrupted qcow2 files)
 * qemu-img: qemu-img rebase works now even when the input file doesn't
             have a backing file yet
 * VMDK block driver now has read-only support for the seSparse subformat
 * GPIO: support for SiFive GPIO controller
 * and lots more...

Thank you to everyone involved!
