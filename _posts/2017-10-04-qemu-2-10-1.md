We are pleased to announce that the QEMU v2.10.1 stable release
is now available! You can grab the tarball from our

Version 2.10.1 is now tagged in the official
[qemu.git repository](https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/commits/v2.10.1/)
(where you can also find the changelog with details), and the
[stable-2.10 branch](https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/commits/stable-2.10)

Apart from the normal range of general fixes, this update contains security
fixes addressing guest-induced crashing of host QEMU process (CVE-2017-13672,
CVE-2017-13673) and possible code injection into host QEMU process via a
crafted multiboot ELF kernel when specified directly via QEMU command-line
option (CVE-2017-14167). Please update accordingly.
