QEMU is participating in [Google Summer of Code
2020](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) again this year!  Google Summer of
Code (GSoC) is an internship program that brings students into open source
development.  GSoC offers full-time remote work opportunities for talented new
developers wishing to get involved in our community.

Each intern works with one or more mentors who support them in their project.
Code is submitted through QEMU's open source development process, giving the
intern experience in open source software development.

If you are interested in contributing to QEMU through a paid 12-week internship
from May to August, take a look at [our project
ideas](https://wiki.qemu.org/Google_Summer_of_Code_2020) for more information.
Applications are open March 16-31, 2020.

Please review the [eligibility
criteria](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/faq#what_are_the_eligibility_requirements_for_participation) before applying.

QEMU is also participating in the [Outreachy internship
program](https://www.outreachy.org/apply/project-selection/#qemu), so be sure
to check that out as well!
