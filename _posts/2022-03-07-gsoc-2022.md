We have great news to share: QEMU has been accepted as a [Google Summer of
Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) 2022 organization! Google Summer of
Code is an open source internship program offering paid remote work
opportunities for contributing to open source. The internship runs from June
13th to September 12th.

Now is the chance to get involved in QEMU development! The QEMU community has
put together a list of project ideas
[here](https://wiki.qemu.org/Google_Summer_of_Code_2022).

Google has dropped the requirement that you need to be enrolled in a higher
education course. We're excited to work with a wider range of contributors this
year! For details on the new eligibility requirements, see
[here](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/faq#what_are_the_eligibility_requirements_for_participation).

You can [submit your
application](https://wiki.qemu.org/Google_Summer_of_Code_2022#2._Fill_out_the_application_form)
from April 4th to 19th.

GSoC interns work together with their mentors, experienced QEMU contributors
who support their interns in their projects. Code developed during the
internship is submitted through the same open source development process that
all QEMU contributions follow. This gives interns experience with contributing
to open source software. Some interns then choose to pursue a career in open
source software after completing their internship.

If you have questions about applying for QEMU GSoC, please email [Stefan
Hajnoczi](mailto:stefanha@gmail.com) or ask on the [#qemu-gsoc IRC
channel](https://webchat.oftc.net/?channels=qemu-gsoc).
