QEMU is participating in [Outreachy](https://www.outreachy.org/) again this
year!  Outreachy is an open source internship program for anyone who faces
under-representation, systemic bias, or discrimination in the technology
industry.  Outreachy offers full-time remote work opportunities for talented
new developers wishing to get involved in our community.

Each intern works with one or more mentors who support them in their project.
Code is submitted through QEMU's open source development process, giving the
intern experience in open source software development.

If you are interested in contributing to QEMU through a paid 12-week internship
from May to August, take a look at [our project
ideas](https://www.outreachy.org/apply/project-selection/#qemu) for more
information.

Please review the [eligibility
criteria](https://www.outreachy.org/apply/eligibility/) before applying.

These internships are generously funded by Red Hat.
